        <h2> About Notre Dame </h2>
        
        <br> <br>
        
        <p> University of Notre Dame is a private institution that was founded in 1842. It has a total undergraduate enrollment of 8,973 (fall 2021), its setting is suburban, and the campus size is 1,265 acres. It utilizes a semester-based academic calendar. Its tuition and fees are $60,301. </p>
        
        <br> <br>

        <p> Notre Dame is located in South Bend, Ind., just 100 miles outside of Chicago. Only freshmen are required to live on campus, but most students choose to remain on campus in one of the 30 single-sex residence halls. The halls serve as the centers of social life at Notre Dame, as there is no Greek life on campus.  The Notre Dame "Fighting Irish" have about 20 varsity NCAA Division I athletic teams and are well known for their consistently strong football program. Over half of students study abroad for at least one semester. </p>

        <br> <br>
        
        <p> Notre Dame is divided into eight schools and colleges, the largest of which is the College of Arts and Letters. Notre Dameâ€™s graduate and professional programs include the highly ranked Mendoza College of Business and Law School in addition to a well-regarded School of Architecture, which offers undergraduate and graduate programs. </p>
