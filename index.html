        <h2> About Me </h2>
        
        <p> My Name is David Vazquez.  I have lived in Southern California most of my life.  The only time I was away from California was when I studied Finance at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.   I spent significant time working at Mitsubishi Motors, Yamaha Motor Corporation, The Boeing Company, and Hyundai Motors.  I retired around 2 years ago after a 22 year career.  One fact about me that many people find interesting is that I have never owned a cell phone.
