         <h4>Love and Marriage</h4>
         <p>Saint Saens fought breifly in the Franco Prussian War in 1870.  During the war he was exiled in England.  On his return
             he found success promoting French music due to the anti-German sentiment caused by the war.  Saint Saens lived a bachelor life until he was 40.  He married 19 year old Marie-Laure Truffot.  The marriage was not a success.  His mother disapproved.  
             He had two sons who both died as childeren.  Andre died at the age
          of 2 from a fall from the 4th floor.  His younger brother Jean-Francois died of pneumonia at six months of age.  
          Saint Saens blamed her for their deaths and their marriage dissolved about 3 years later. </p>

         <h6>Late Life</h6>
         <p>Saint Saens fell out of favor in France for his conservative views.  By the 20th Century his views were out of fashion in Paris.
          He spent a lot of time abroad to give concerts as opposed to being a tourist.  He spent time in London, Berlin, Italy, Spain, Monaco, 
             and the United States.  His nationalism caused him to lead a boycott of German music during the First World War.  This excessive
          nationalism helped alienate him from other musicians who found his nationalism excessive. During the war, he gave concerts to raise 
          money for war charities.  Even late in life he was still giving recitals where those in the audience commented on how precise and vivid
        his playing was.  He died in December 1921 of a heart attack.</p>
