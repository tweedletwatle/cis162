      <h5 class="card-title">Second Republic and Second Empire 1848–1852, 1852–1870</h5>
      <p class="card-text">An attempt to agitate for liberal reforms, coupled with growing dissatisfaction in the monarchy, led to an outbreak of demonstrations against the king in 1848. Faced with the choice of deploying troops or fleeing, he abdicated and fled. A republic was declared and the nephew of Bonaparte, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (or Napoleon III, 1848–1873), was elected president. Only four years later he was proclaimed emperor of a “Second Empire” in a further revolution. However, a humiliating loss in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, when Napoleon was captured, shattered confidence in the regime; a Third Republic was declared in a bloodless revolution in 1870.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Paris Commune 1871</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Parisians, angered by a Prussian siege of Paris, the terms of the peace treaty which ended the Franco-Prussian war and their treatment by the government (which tried to disarm the National Guard in Paris to stall trouble), rose in rebellion. They formed a council to lead them, called the Commune of Paris, and attempted reform. The government of France invaded the capital to restore order, prompting a short period of conflict. The Commune has been mythologized by socialists and revolutionaries ever since.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">The Belle Époque 1871–1914</h5>
      <p class="card-text">A period of rapid commercial, social and cultural development as (relative) peace and further industrial development wrought even greater changes upon society, bringing in mass consumerism. The name, which literally means "Beautiful Age," is largely a retrospective title given by the wealthier classes who benefited most from the era.</p>
